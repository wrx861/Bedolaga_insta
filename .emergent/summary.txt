<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
Initial user request was to study the repository from start to finish (Изучи наш репо... от а до я).
After the analysis, the user requested to refactor the monolithic installer script: разбить на модули установку, сделать скрипт модульным а не один на 2000 строк (break the installation into modules, make the script modular, not one file of 2000 lines).
The latest user request is to improve the  script: Скрипт bot там тоже нужно сделать чтоб выбор был стрелками а не писать цифры в чат , оформление продакшн должно быть (The bot script also needs to be done so that the selection is with arrows instead of writing numbers in the chat, the design should be production-ready).

**User's preferred language**: Русский (Russian)

**what currently exists?**
The project is a command-line installer for a Bedolaga Docker stack, written in Go. The agent has successfully refactored the application from a single 2543-line  file into a modular structure with over 15 discrete  files. The project now has a clean architecture, compiles successfully, and all 11 existing tests pass. The  has been updated to reflect these changes. A separate, simple  bash script for management tasks still exists in its original form.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Planning the refactoring of the  bash script. The user wants to replace the number-based menu with a proper TUI (Text User Interface) featuring arrow-key navigation and a production-ready design, similar to the main installer. The agent's plan is to create a new  command within the main Go application () and have the  script simply execute .
- **Status:** NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Backend testing agent. The agent should instruct the testing agent to run the  script or the new  command and verify the TUI behavior and functionality of its options (e.g., checking logs, restarting services).
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The work queue consists of new feature requests.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Refactor  script into a Go TUI (P0)**
  - **Where to resume:** Begin implementation based on the last plan. Create a new command in the Go application (e.g., ) using the  library to build the TUI. This new command will contain the logic for the 11 management operations currently in the  script. Finally, replace the contents of the  script with a single line that calls the new Go command: .
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The  management script will be upgraded from a primitive bash script to a user-friendly, robust Go TUI, providing a consistent user experience with the main installer.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend (CLI tool testing).
  - **Blocked on something:** No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- None have been defined beyond the  script refactoring.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Go Project Analysis**: Fully analyzed the existing Go-based CLI installer.
- **Monolith Refactoring**: Broke down the single  file into a modular structure with 15+ new files for better maintainability (e.g., , , , , etc.).
- **Build Environment Setup**: Installed and configured the correct Go version (1.24.4) in the environment.
- **Code Verification**: Ensured the refactored code compiles (), passes static analysis (), and all unit tests ().
- **Version Update**: Incremented the project version in  to  and updated the corresponding unit test in .
- **Documentation Update**: Updated the  file to reflect the new modular source code structure.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **UI**: CLI / TUI (Text User Interface) using the  library.
- **Core Technology**: The application is a wrapper around Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, and Caddy to automate the deployment of a web service stack.

**key DB schema**
- N/A. The tool manages a PostgreSQL container, but its internal schema is not defined within this project.

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes. The agent installed the required Go compiler to work on the existing Go project.

**All files of reference**
- **Created**: , , , , , , , , , , , , , . These files exist to modularize the original monolithic .
- **Updated**:
    - : Refactored to be a simple entry point, version updated.
    - : Test updated to check for the new version.
    - : Documentation updated to match the new file structure.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  script needs to be refactored into the main Go application as per the user's latest request.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A (This is a CLI application, not a web service).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The primary task was a major refactoring of a monolithic Go application into a modular structure. This is complete and verified. The next task is to apply a similar modernization approach to the  management script, converting it from bash to a Go TUI. The project uses the  library, which should be used for the new TUI components.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Working:** The entire refactored Go application is healthy, builds successfully, and passes all tests.
- **Broken:** None.
- **Mocked:** None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
The application orchestrates the following services, but does not integrate them as code libraries:
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Nginx
- Caddy
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (Agent performed manual testing with  and ).
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
- **Test files created:** None.  was modified.
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
Nothing. The agent successfully completed the large refactoring task and correctly identified and planned the next task based on the user's follow-up request.</analysis>
